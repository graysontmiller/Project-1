# mynighttho.me

A web application developed with JavaScript, JQuery, HTML, and the Foundation CSS framework. Utilizing the [Spoonacular API.](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) and the [themoviedb API.](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)

# Description

Mynighttho.me is a web application aimed at helping eliminate decisions when it comes to planning your night. Using the application allows you to generate both a recipe for dinner as well as a trending movie to watch, all you have to do is tell it your preferences.

This group project was made for the UNCC Web Development boot-camp project 1. The goal of this project was to develop an application to demonstrate all of the skills that we have learned up until now. We were given total freedom in this project with the exception of the following requirements:
- We could not use bootstrap
- We had to use local storage 
- We had to utilize 2 different server-side APIS
# User Story:
AS a busy person

I WANT to be able to plan out my night quickly and with minimal effort

SO THAT I can have a spontaneous plan without being daunted by having to make decisions. 
# Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN an array of options

WHEN I respond to the questions 

THEN I am given a random, tailored plan for my night.

# Final Reflection

This project was a good challenge for each of us because it was the first time we had worked on anything collaboratively before and was also the first time we were charged with creating anything without a clear direction for it. We had a lot of trouble figuring out what kind of application to make and which APIS to use. Our first few ideas did not pan out due to our ideal APIS being paid or requiring CORS policies. By the time we finally settled on an app we were able to progress fairly quickly with our JavaScript. 

Our group's biggest struggle was figuring out how to do things together without running into merge-conflicts. Our communication lacked a bit when it came to working branches and this led to a lot of commits and having to work over each other, but we made up for it by working together in person. Our biggest thing to work on in the future is group communication and better planning so that we can avoid wasted time with merge conflicts and issues.
